# Interrogation Room Service

Interrogation Room Service

## Description

The Interrogation Room Service (IRS) interfaces with the Encryption Key Store Service to process Crypt4GH encrypted files uploaded to the inbox of a local GHGA node.
The IRS splits off the file envelope, computes part checksums over the encrypted file content, validates the checksum over the unencrypted file content (in memory) and initiates transfer of the encrypted file content to its permanent storage.


## Installation

We recommend using the provided Docker container.

A pre-built version is available at [docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/ghga/interrogation-room-service):
```bash
docker pull ghga/interrogation-room-service:5.1.0
```

Or you can build the container yourself from the [`./Dockerfile`](./Dockerfile):
```bash
# Execute in the repo's root dir:
docker build -t ghga/interrogation-room-service:5.1.0 .
```

For production-ready deployment, we recommend using Kubernetes, however,
for simple use cases, you could execute the service using docker
on a single server:
```bash
# The entrypoint is preconfigured:
docker run -p 8080:8080 ghga/interrogation-room-service:5.1.0 --help
```

If you prefer not to use containers, you may install the service from source:
```bash
# Execute in the repo's root dir:
pip install .

# To run the service:
irs --help
```

## Configuration

### Parameters

The service requires the following configuration parameters:
- <a id="properties/enable_opentelemetry"></a>**`enable_opentelemetry`** *(boolean)*: If set to true, this will run necessary setup code.If set to false, environment variables are set that should also effectively disable autoinstrumentation. Default: `false`.

- <a id="properties/otel_trace_sampling_rate"></a>**`otel_trace_sampling_rate`** *(number)*: Determines which proportion of spans should be sampled. A value of 1.0 means all and is equivalent to the previous behaviour. Setting this to 0 will result in no spans being sampled, but this does not automatically set `enable_opentelemetry` to False.

### Usage:

A template YAML for configuring the service can be found at
[`./example-config.yaml`](./example-config.yaml).
Please adapt it, rename it to `.irs.yaml`, and place it in one of the following locations:
- in the current working directory where you execute the service (on Linux: `./.irs.yaml`)
- in your home directory (on Linux: `~/.irs.yaml`)

The config yaml will be automatically parsed by the service.

**Important: If you are using containers, the locations refer to paths within the container.**

All parameters mentioned in the [`./example-config.yaml`](./example-config.yaml)
could also be set using environment variables or file secrets.

For naming the environment variables, just prefix the parameter name with `irs_`,
e.g. for the `host` set an environment variable named `irs_host`
(you may use both upper or lower cases, however, it is standard to define all env
variables in upper cases).

To use file secrets, please refer to the
[corresponding section](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/usage/settings/#secret-support)
of the pydantic documentation.



## Architecture and Design:
This is a Python-based service following the Triple Hexagonal Architecture pattern.
It uses protocol/provider pairs and dependency injection mechanisms provided by the
[hexkit](https://github.com/ghga-de/hexkit) library.


## Development

For setting up the development environment, we rely on the
[devcontainer feature](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) of VS Code
in combination with Docker Compose.

To use it, you have to have Docker Compose as well as VS Code with its "Remote - Containers"
extension (`ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers`) installed.
Then open this repository in VS Code and run the command
`Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container` from the VS Code "Command Palette".

This will give you a full-fledged, pre-configured development environment including:
- infrastructural dependencies of the service (databases, etc.)
- all relevant VS Code extensions pre-installed
- pre-configured linting and auto-formatting
- a pre-configured debugger
- automatic license-header insertion

Moreover, inside the devcontainer, a command `dev_install` is available for convenience.
It installs the service with all development dependencies, and it installs pre-commit.

The installation is performed automatically when you build the devcontainer. However,
if you update dependencies in the [`./pyproject.toml`](./pyproject.toml) or the
[`./requirements-dev.txt`](./requirements-dev.txt), please run it again.
