# Download Controller Service

Download Controller Service - a GA4GH DRS-compliant service for delivering files from S3 encrypted according to the GA4GH Crypt4GH standard.

## Description

This service implements the
[GA4GH DRS](https://github.com/ga4gh/data-repository-service-schemas) v1.0.0 for
serving files that where encrypted according to the
[GA4GH Crypt4GH](https://www.ga4gh.org/news/crypt4gh-a-secure-method-for-sharing-human-genetic-data/)
from S3-compatible object storages.

Thereby, only the `GET /objects/{object_id}` is implemented. It always returns
an access_method for the object via S3. This makes the second endpoint
`GET /objects/{object_id}/access/{access_id}` that
is contained in the DRS spec unnecessary. For more details see the OpenAPI spec
described below.

For authorization, a JSON web token is expected via Bearer Authentication that has a format
described [here](./dcs/core/auth_policies.py).

All files that can be requested are registered in a MongoDB database owned and
controlled by this service. Registration of new events happens through a Kafka event.

It serves pre-signed URLs to S3 objects located in a single so-called outbox bucket.
If the file is not already in the bucket when the user calls the object endpoint,
an event is published to request staging the file to the outbox. The staging has to
be carried out by a different service.

For more details on the events consumed and produced by this service, see the
configuration.

The DRS object endpoint serves files in an encrypted fashion as described by the
Crypt4GH standard, but without the evelope. A user-specific envelope can be requested
from the `GET /objects/{object_id}/envelopes` endpoint. The actual envelope creation
is delegated to another service via a RESTful call. Please see the configuration for
further details.


## Installation

We recommend using the provided Docker container.

A pre-build version is available at [docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/ghga/download-controller-service):
```bash
docker pull ghga/download-controller-service:1.1.0
```

Or you can build the container yourself from the [`./Dockerfile`](./Dockerfile):
```bash
# Execute in the repo's root dir:
docker build -t ghga/download-controller-service:1.1.0 .
```

For production-ready deployment, we recommend using Kubernetes, however,
for simple use cases, you could execute the service using docker
on a single server:
```bash
# The entrypoint is preconfigured:
docker run -p 8080:8080 ghga/download-controller-service:1.1.0 --help
```

If you prefer not to use containers, you may install the service from source:
```bash
# Execute in the repo's root dir:
pip install .

# To run the service:
dcs --help
```

### Usage:

A template YAML for configurating the service can be found at
[`./example-config.yaml`](./example-config.yaml).
Please adapt it, rename it to `.dcs.yaml`, and place it into one of the following locations:
- in the current working directory were you are execute the service (on unix: `./.dcs.yaml`)
- in your home directory (on unix: `~/.dcs.yaml`)

The config yaml will be automatically parsed by the service.

**Important: If you are using containers, the locations refer to paths within the container.**

All parameters mentioned in the [`./example-config.yaml`](./example-config.yaml)
could also be set using environment variables or file secrets.

For naming the environment variables, just prefix the parameter name with `dcs_`,
e.g. for the `host` set an environment variable named `dcs_host`
(you may use both upper or lower cases, however, it is standard to define all env
variables in upper cases).

To using file secrets please refer to the
[corresponding section](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/usage/settings/#secret-support)
of the pydantic documentation.

## HTTP API
An OpenAPI specification for this service can be found [here](./openapi.yaml).

## Architecture and Design:
<!-- Please provide an overview of the architecture and design of the code base.
Mention anything that deviates from the standard triple hexagonal architecture and
the corresponding structure. -->

This is a Python-based service following the Triple Hexagonal Architecture pattern.
It uses protocol/provider pairs and dependency injection mechanisms provided by the
[hexkit](https://github.com/ghga-de/hexkit) library.


## Development

For setting up the development environment, we rely on the
[devcontainer feature](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) of VS Code
in combination with Docker Compose.

To use it, you have to have Docker Compose as well as VS Code with its "Remote - Containers"
extension (`ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers`) installed.
Then open this repository in VS Code and run the command
`Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container` from the VS Code "Command Palette".

This will give you a full-fledged, pre-configured development environment including:
- infrastructural dependencies of the service (databases, etc.)
- all relevant VS Code extensions pre-installed
- pre-configured linting and auto-formatting
- a pre-configured debugger
- automatic license-header insertion

Moreover, inside the devcontainer, a convenience commands `dev_install` is available.
It installs the service with all development dependencies, installs pre-commit.

The installation is performed automatically when you build the devcontainer. However,
if you update dependencies in the [`./pyproject.toml`](./pyproject.toml) or the
[`./requirements-dev.txt`](./requirements-dev.txt), please run it again.
